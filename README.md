### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Daniel and I'm a software engineer from Israel. I've been doing backend development for the past 5+ years, before discovering creative coding and generative art. After that I decided to switch to graphics programming. I've been passionate about video games and game development since early age, and I even started my programming journey with learning how to develop games.
