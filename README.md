### Hey ðŸ‘‹,

I'm Daniel, a software engineer hailing from Israel. I've been immersed in backend development for over 5 years. Recently, I stumbled upon the world of creative coding and generative art, prompting me to make a shift to graphics programming. Over the last 2 years, I've been diving deep into this fascinating field.

My passion for video games and game development has been with me since a young age, and my programming journey actually kicked off with learning how to develop games. What I find most fulfilling about programming is its creative aspect, bringing visuals and aesthetically pleasing creations to life.

Here are my latest projects:

- [Generative art sketches](https://github.com/monkeyroar/sketches) written in TypeScript, utilizing Pixi.js, Three.js, and pure WebGL APIs.
- [My personal website](https://github.com/codedpalette/codedpalette.github.io) written in Svelte and TypeScript, showcasing my generative artworks.
